# Core Wars 4 

by Raff Martinez-Marjanski

Simulation program allowing you to design maps and AI to fight one another.
Based on original idea by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney from 1984

### Installation

To run CW4 use JDK 10 unless you are familiar with JavaFX.
Lately there are problems installing JavaFX runtime, it should be included in JDK 7 and above but it's not really :)
I've tested it with JDK 10 on many platforms and it seems to be the easiest way to start the app.
It also comes with batteries included, all dependencies are in lib directory within the project. It does not use Gradle, all dependencies are static.

If you use InteliJ Idea just click "New project from existing sources", select JDK10 and you should be good to go.

### Development

There's a lot of work still, if you're bored feel free to fork and contribute.
